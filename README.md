## Getting Started

To run this application you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Run the Application



### Get the code

[Download](https://github.com/thiruppathi/my-sky) and extract my-sky to where you want to work.

### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your my-sky download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

**my-sky** requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd my-sky && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the polymer-element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools **my-sky** requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

gulp.js uses **browser-sync**, which enables to test the Responsiveness of the page, simultaneously across many devices for different viewports.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Testing Evidences
###Service Tests - Automated Mocha (TDD & BDD)
All Services to and From Firebase are tested using Mocha.js.
TDD is achieved using Asset.
BDD is achieved using Expect.js

####Customer Location Service Test

A CustomerLocationService is available which will take the customerID as an input and return one of the following outputs.

| Customer Service| Output Description |￼
|:------------- |:-------------|| A location identifier| Customer is valid and a locationID is returned |￼| Failure exception| There was a problem retrieving the customer information|
##### Evidence
[test-customer-location-service.js](app/test/test-customer-location-service.js)
````shcd app/test/
mocha test-customer-location-service.js

####Catalogue Service Test

The locationID returned from CustomerLocationService should be passed to a CatalogueService, which must return the following products.
￼| Category | Product | Dependent on locationID |
|:------------- |:-------------|:-----|
|￼ Sports| Arsenal TV | LONDON |
| Sports| Chelsea TV | LONDON |
￼| Sports| Liverpool TV| LIVERPOOL|
￼| News| Sky News|  |
￼| News| Sky Sports News|  |



1. The CatalogueService will only return ArsenalTV and ChelseaTV if the locationID is LONDON. 
2. The CatalogueService will only return LiverpoolTV if the locationID is LIVERPOOL.3. The CatalogueService will always return Sky News and Sky Sports News.
