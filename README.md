## Getting Started

To run this application you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Run the Application


### Get the code

[Download](https://github.com/Thiruppathi/my-sky/archive/master.zip) and extract my-sky to where you want to work.

### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your my-sky download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

**my-sky** requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd my-sky && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the polymer-element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools **my-sky** requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

gulp.js uses **browser-sync**, which enables to test the Responsiveness of the page, simultaneously across many devices for different viewports.


#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Testing Evidences
###Service Tests - Automated Mocha (TDD & BDD)
All Services to and From Firebase are tested using Mocha.js.
TDD is achieved using Asset.
BDD is achieved using Expect.js

####Customer Location Service Test

A CustomerLocationService is available which will take the customerID as an input and return one of the following outputs.

#####Evidence

[See Unit Test Script for Customer Location Service](https://github.com/Thiruppathi/my-sky/blob/master/app/test/test-customer-location-service.js)

#####Execution
Execute the test throgh following command.

````sh
cd app/test/
mocha test-customer-location-service.js
````

####Catalogue Service Test

The locationID returned from CustomerLocationService should be passed to a CatalogueService, which must return the following products.

1. The CatalogueService will only return ArsenalTV and ChelseaTV if the locationID is LONDON. 
2. The CatalogueService will only return LiverpoolTV if the locationID is LIVERPOOL.
3. The CatalogueService will always return Sky News and Sky Sports News.

#####Evidence
[See Unit Test Script for Catalogue Service](https://github.com/Thiruppathi/my-sky/blob/master/app/test/test-catalogue-service.js)

#####Execution

````sh
cd app/test/

| Click - SignOut| Clear the Basket. Clear the CheckBox Selection. Redirect To Landing Page | Pass |

#### Confirmation Page

| Test Description           | Expected Result  | Test Result |
|:------------- |:-------------|:-----|

#### Known Issues/Bugs

* On Product-Selection Page, When the customer doesn't have any sports channel for his location, he would be able to see a blank panel. Expected result is hiding the panel, when there are no sports channel available for his location.

* Users are requested to Sign Out after completing a Order. As the customer id is maintained across the page, the selected channels for one customer can appear for another customer.
