Get a copy of the code.\r\n2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.\r\n3. Run the Application\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the code\r\n\r\n[Download](https://github.com/Thiruppathi/my-sky/archive/master.zip) and extract my-sky to where you want to work.\r\n\r\n### Install dependencies\r\n\r\n#### Quick-start\r\n\r\nWith Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your my-sky download:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites (for everyone)\r\n\r\n**my-sky** requires the following major dependencies:\r\n\r\n- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.\r\n- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.\r\n- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.\r\n- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).\r\n\r\n**To install dependencies:**\r\n\r\n1)  Check your Node.js version.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnode --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe version should be at or above 0.12.x.\r\n\r\n2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.\r\n\r\n3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install -g gulp bower\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.\r\n\r\n4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd my-sky && npm install && bower install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis installs the polymer-element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools **my-sky** requires to build and serve apps.\r\n\r\n### Development workflow\r\n\r\n#### Serve / watch\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.\r\n\r\ngulp.js uses **browser-sync**, which enables to test the Responsiveness of the page, simultaneously across many devices for different viewports.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Build & Vulcanize\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.\r\n\r\n## Firebase\r\nPlease create a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) account to access the database.\r\nIf you need to have collaborator access to the database, please [contact](https://twitter.com/thiruppathi) me.\r\n\r\n## Testing Evidences\r\n###Service Tests - Automated Mocha (TDD & BDD)\r\nAll Services to and From Firebase are tested using Mocha.js.\r\nTDD is achieved using Asset.\r\nBDD is achieved using Expect.js\r\n\r\n####Customer Location Service Test\r\n\r\nA CustomerLocationService is available which will take the customerID as an input and return one of the following outputs.\r\n\r\n#####Evidence\r\n\r\n[See Unit Test Script for Customer Location Service](https://github.com/Thiruppathi/my-sky/blob/master/app/test/test-customer-location-service.js)\r\n\r\n#####Execution\r\nExecute the test throgh following command.\r\n\r\n````sh\r\ncd app/test/\r\nmocha test-customer-location-service.js\r\n````\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/9jg8ph0vcpcl7th45ngq97p6t\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/9jg8ph0vcpcl7th45ngq97p6t.png\" width=\"705\"/></a>\r\n\r\n####Catalogue Service Test\r\n\r\nThe locationID returned from CustomerLocationService should be passed to a CatalogueService, which must return the following products.\r\n\r\n1.
